Lists are mutable 
########
Tuples, Strings are immutable 

####### we can create a new tuple every time users book a cab as location will not change and tuples are immutable so in tuple we can store lang, long of user's location

# Sets 
they are unordered and non-duplicates dictonaries 
eg sets = {1,2,3,4,5,6,6}
